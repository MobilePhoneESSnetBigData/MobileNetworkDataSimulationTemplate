\usage{
HMM(...)

\method{HMM}{integer}(S, TL, CT, EM = NULL)

\method{HMM}{numeric}(S, ...)

\method{HMM}{character}(S, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Number or names of states. It can be either a numeric or a
character.}

\item{TL}{Matrix of integers that lists non-zero transitions.
The matrix corresponds to the field transitions of the object
(see details).}

\item{CT}{Matrix of constraints. It corresponds to the field
constraints of the object (see details).}

\item{EM}{Matrix of emissions. It corresponds to the field
emissions of the object (see details).}
}
\value{
A HMM model object.
}
\description{
Creates an HMM object, as specified.
}
\details{
The HMM object contains five fields: states, transitions,
constraints, emisions and parameters.

The field states contains a character vector with the names of
the states. If the constructor is given a number S, it sets the
names as follows: as.character(1:S). An additional field, called
coordinates is provided too, were in the future the geolocation of
the states will be specified. Note that state determines geolocation,
but different states might share geolocation.

The field transitions contain a matrix which is a list of the
transitions with non-zero probability. It is a two row integer matrix
where each column represents the transition from first row state
to second row state. The states are referenced in the same order as
they appear in field states. While (number of states)^2 transitions
are possible, a much smaller number is expected. It defaults to still
transitions for all states.

The field constraints is the augmented matrix of the system of
linear equalities that the model must fulfill. The variables of the
system correspond to the probabilities of transition, in the same
order as in field transitions. The constraints that restrict the
transition matrix to be stochastic are treated automatically.

The field emissions consists in a matrix that contains the emission
probabilities, where the number of rows is the number of states and
each column correspond to a possible output. Unlike usual, the
emission probabilities are fixed.

The field parameters contain additional information about the
probabilities of transition and the initial state of the model.
Also some auxiliar information to reduce the number of parameters
of the model. See initparams, minparams and initsteady.
